# Simplified Transactions

## About the project
A backend project, made with Java using Spring Framework, that represents simple transactions that can be done from user to user.

The transactions before completed, are retrieving a mocked json from [https://designer.mocky.io/](https://designer.mocky.io/), as an example of an external service that authorizes the transaction.

Also, when a transaction is authorized, the user that received the money is being notified by E-mail and SMS. Both notifications are asynchronous, and will be triggered after 10 seconds.

API and Integration Tests were done and you can run all of them with 
>mvnw test

### With Docker
If you want to use docker, there's a docker-compose.yml file in the repository that will do the work, you just need to have two images
* [mysql:8.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/mysql/library/mysql/8.0/images/sha256-930e762c3f185d55d96a65e0d6cb2f724ffc16a87270f85283ae099d75e92ad0?context=explore)
* [alsgomes/simplified-transactions:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/alsgomes/simplified-transactions-api)

After pulling the images, re-tag the [alsgomes/simplified-transactions:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/alsgomes/simplified-transactions-api) to just [simplified-transactions:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/alsgomes/simplified-transactions-api)

Run the docker-compose file and it will be deployed by default at port 8080
